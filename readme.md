# This is my portfolio website. I built it in only one day because as I am a freelancer I had some projects going on. That's why I failed to manage enough time to create this website. I wanted to create more sections and add animations along with mobile navigation but didn't due to time constraints. I will try to impove it more in future. I didn't get much time to polish it! :( But I built it with all the modern technologies and following all the modern standards and conventions.
